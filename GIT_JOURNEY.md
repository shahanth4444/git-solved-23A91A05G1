## Conflicts Resolved

### Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Production used port 8080, development used 3000
- **Resolution**: Created unified config with environment-based settings
- **Strategy**: Keep production as default, add dev as optional
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Different database hosts and SSL modes
- **Resolution**: Created separate profiles for production and development
- **Strategy**: Restructured JSON to support both environments
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Different deployment strategies (production vs docker-compose)
- **Resolution**: Added conditional logic based on DEPLOY_ENV variable
- **Strategy**: Made script handle both environments dynamically
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: Different monitoring intervals and log formats
- **Resolution**: Environment-based configuration object
- **Strategy**: Used process.env.NODE_ENV to determine behavior
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Different architectural descriptions
- **Resolution**: Merged both descriptions into comprehensive document
- **Strategy**: Created sections for each environment
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Different feature lists and version numbers
- **Resolution**: Combined all features with clear environment labels
- **Strategy**: Organized features by category
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

### Merge 2: main + conflict-simulator (5 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: New experimental settings introduced.
- **Resolution**: Maintained the stable combined production/development config.
- **Strategy**: Commented out the experimental settings to prevent breakage.
- **Difficulty**: Medium

#### Conflict 2: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Experimental docker purge step added.
- **Resolution**: Maintained the stable multi-environment deploy script.
- **Strategy**: Commented out the experimental deploy steps.
- **Difficulty**: Easy

#### Conflict 3: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: New experimental database connection added.
- **Resolution**: Maintained the stable production/development profiles.
- **Strategy**: Commented out the experimental configuration to maintain stability.
- **Difficulty**: Medium

#### Conflict 4: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Documentation for experimental services added.
- **Resolution**: Merged the experimental sections into the document.
- **Strategy**: Created a new "Experimental Services" section in the documentation.
- **Difficulty**: Easy

#### Conflict 5: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: New experimental AI monitor function added.
- **Resolution**: Maintained the stable environment-based monitoring script.
- **Strategy**: Commented out the experimental AI monitoring function.
- **Difficulty**: Easy

## Most Challenging Parts
1. **Understanding Conflict Markers**: Initially confused by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` symbols. Learned that HEAD is current branch and the other side is incoming changes.
2. **Deciding What to Keep**: Hardest part was choosing between conflicting code. Learned to read both versions completely before deciding.
3. **Complex Logic Conflicts**: deploy.sh had completely different logic. Had to understand both approaches before combining.

## Key Learnings
- Mastered conflict resolution process by manually editing files.
- Understood the difference between `git merge` (history graph) and `git rebase` (linear history).
- Practiced using `git stash` for context switching with unfinished work.
- Learned to use `git revert` for a safe undo on shared history.
- Used `git tag` to mark project releases.

## Reflection
This challenge taught me that merge conflicts aren't scaryâ€”they're just Git asking "which version do you want?". The key is understanding what each side is trying to do before combining them. I now feel confident handling conflicts in real projects.
